## **Challenges and Obstacles**

During the development of Hanchau.app, several challenges and obstacles were encountered. One of the initial concerns was ensuring the accuracy of the content provided within the app. To address this, reliable open sources funded by governments were extensively researched to obtain verified exercise and nutrition data.

Additionally, time management was a crucial aspect as the project was undertaken while the team members still had full-time jobs. To optimize development efforts, existing development tools such as Firebase were utilized, allowing the team to focus on implementing key features without compromising quality.

## **Results**

While Hanchau.app is still under development, the team is actively seeking testing opportunities among friends and family to gather valuable user feedback. The app's focus on providing a seamless and efficient record-taking experience, without unnecessary features, sets it apart from other fitness and nutrition tracking applications. The team's commitment to privacy and data security is ensured through the utilization of Firebase's robust infrastructure, including authentication and Firestore database.

Working on Hanchau.app has provided the team members with valuable learning experiences. As developers, they have had the opportunity to collaborate closely with a designer, gaining insights into product development and enhancing communication skills. Being responsible for the entire development process has allowed them to expand their knowledge and decision-making abilities. As a designer, it is always tricky when it comes to side projects. It is one thing that a designer designs something beautiful, and it is another that a design gets actually developed. Having a dev partner definitely makes a side project so much more meaningful for a designer as product design is never only about creating the visuals but also the consideration of market fit, tech constraints, and how the problems are being solved.

## **[Component System](https://jerry-yeh.github.io/Han-Chau)**

Utilizing TailwindCSS as the CSS foundation and integrating certain components from Ant-Design, the component system demonstrates multiple situations in Storybook that you can discuss with designers more efficiently in the early stage of development. Storybook serves as both a component system and exhaustive documentation, allowing you to directly grasp the purpose and the complete usage of each parameter.

You can experience the live demonstration of the component system through this <a href="https://jerry-yeh.github.io/Han-Chau" target="_blank">**link**</a>.
